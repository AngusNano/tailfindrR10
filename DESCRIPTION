Description: tailfindr is an alignment-free tool (i.e., no BAM/SAM files are needed) to find poly(A)/poly(T) tail lengths in 1D Oxford nanopore sequencing reads. It can handle reads from basecalled with Albacore or Guppy using the standard or the newest 'flip-flop' model. It can work with single and multi-fast5 files. Currently, tailfinder can find poly(A) tail lengths in 1D RNA nanopore reads, and both poly(A) and poly(T) lengths in 1D DNA nanopore reads.
