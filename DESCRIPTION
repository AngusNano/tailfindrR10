Description: tailfinder is an alignment-free tool (i.e., no BAM/SAM files are needed) to find poly(A)/poly(T) tail lengths in 1D nanopore sequencing reads. It can handle both Albacore data and the new Flip-flop data. It also handle signle or multifast5 files. Currently it find poly(A) tail lengths 1D RNA nanopore reads, and both poly(A) and poly(T) lengths in 1D DNA nanopore reads.
